- This code simulates a bus stop where buses arrive at random intervals, and riders arrive at random intervals. The program uses the Semaphore and AtomicInteger classes from the Java concurrency library to coordinate the actions of the bus and rider threads.\

- The Bus thread runs an infinite loop in which the thread first tries to acquire the bus semaphore, which allows it to access the bus. Then it calls the drainPermits() method on the waitingRiders semaphore which gets the number of permits that are currently available, and atomically sets the semaphore's permit count to zero. If there are no riders waiting, the bus departs. Otherwise, the thread calculates the number of riders that can board the bus by taking the minimum of the number of riders waiting and the number of available spots on the bus. Then it releases that many permits on the allAboard semaphore, which allows that many riders to board the bus. Then it subtracts the number of riders that boarded from the number of available spots. Then it calls the acquire method on allAboard semaphore, which blocks the thread until all the riders have boarded. If there are more riders waiting than the bus can accommodate, the thread releases the extra riders back to the waitingRiders semaphore. Finally, the thread departs and releases the bus semaphore so that it can be used by another thread.

- The Rider thread runs an infinite loop in which the thread first generates a random inter-arrival time for the rider and then sleeps for that amount of time. After waking up, the thread releases a permit on the waitingRiders semaphore, which represents that a new rider has arrived. Then it calls the acquire method on the allAboard semaphore, which blocks the thread until the bus arrives and a spot becomes available for the rider to board. Then it increments the number of available spots and calls the board() method.

- When the bus thread calls the release method with the number of riders that it can board, it increases the count of the semaphore allAboard by the number of riders that it can board.
